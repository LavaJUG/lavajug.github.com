*Note: Cette session sera présentée dans la langue de Shakespeare*

Secure software requires making a wide variety of **security controls** available to the **developer**. These controls range from automatic defenses to APIs that developers simply need to use, to controls that require extensive configuration and understanding to be used effectively. This session reviews several **new security controls** available on the **Java 8 and 9** platforms. It also covers other important Java security work, such as how the server JRE decreases the attack surface by not including applet code—since 2013! The presentation will help raise awareness of the many defenses present and available in the Java ecosystem, **something every Java developer can benefit from**.
