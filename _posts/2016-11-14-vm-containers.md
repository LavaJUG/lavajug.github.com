*Note: Cette session sera présentée dans la langue de Molière*

Everybody is now using **virtualization**, **containers** are all the rage today, and **microkernels** start to gain traction… But how is all this working? How did these solutions come to be? What are the **differences between containers and virtual machines?** Where and why should you use **docker**, **runc**, **rocket**, **kvm**, **xen**, **virtualbox**, **includeOS**, **rancherOS**? This talk is a full session providing understanding on how these technologies work, how they compare to each other, and lot’s of demo to understand differences and fundamental concept on isolation. So, let’s look under the hood, and understand how your system works (hint: it’s not magic). And yes, it will be understandable even if you are not an OPS or an expert. That’s precisely the point.
